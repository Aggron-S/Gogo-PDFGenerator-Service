# Gogo-PDFGenerator-Service üîå
A custom web service built for automating PDF generation from data coming in external online platforms such as Kintone or Zoho Creator.


## üí° Overview
**Gogo-PDFGenerator-Service** automates the generation of PDF documents filled with data collected from platforms such as **[Kintone](https://www.kintone.com/)** or **[Zoho Creator](https://www.zoho.com/creator/)**.

It utilizes:  
- The **[Canva Connect API](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/)** to auto-fill and generate PDFs based on pre-designed templates via the *Bulk Create* feature.  
- The **[Dropbox API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/overview)** to store PDF files in a secure and accessible cloud location.

This custom web service built in **Node.js** acts as the orchestration layer, enabling seamless communication between systems.
